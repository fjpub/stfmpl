abstract = "Currently, Java is one of the most used programming language, being adopted in many large projects, where applications reach a level of complexity for which manual testing and human inspection are not enough to guarantee quality in software development. Even when using automated unit tests, such tests rarely cover all interesting cases of code, which means that a bug could never be discovered, once the code is tested against the same set of rules over and over again. This paper addresses the problem of generating random well-typed programs in the context of Featherweight Java, a well-known object-oriented calculus, using QuickCheck, a Haskell library for property-based testing."

abstract="Property-based testing of compilers or programming languages semantics is difficult to accomplish because it is hard to design a random generator for valid programs. Most compiler test tools do not have a well-specified way of generating type-correct programs, which is a requirement for such testing activities. In this work, we formalize a type-directed procedure to generate random well-typed programs in the context of Featherweight Java, a well-known object-oriented calculus for the Java programming language. We implement the approach using the Haskell programming language and verify it against relevant properties using QuickCheck, a library for property-based testing.",

Accordingly, I have written a new textbook, Programming Language Foundations in Agda (PLFA). PLFA covers much of the same ground as SF, although it is not a slavish imitation.",

abstract = "In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus."

	abstract = {TLS is such a widespread security protocol that errors in its implementation can have disastrous consequences. This responsibility is mostly borne by programmers, caught between specifications with the ambiguities of natural language and error-prone low-level parsing of network packets. We report here on the construction in the Coq proof-assistant of libraries to model, specify, and verify C programs to process TLS packets. We provide in particular an encoding of the core subset of C whose originality lies in its use of dependent types to guarantee statically well-formedness of datatypes and correct typing. We further equip this encoding with a Separation logic that enables byte-level reasoning and also provide a logical view of data structures.  We also formalize a significant part of the RFC for TLS, again using dependent types to capture succinctly constraints that are left implicit in the prose document.  Finally, we apply the above framework to an existing implementation of TLS (namely, PolarSSL) of which we specify and verify a parsing function for network packets. Thanks to this experiment, we were able to spot ambiguities in the RFC and to correct bugs in the C source code.},
